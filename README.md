# BibTeX::Parser

`BibTeX::Parser` is a pure Perl BibTeX parser, originally developed by Gerhard Gossen, later improved by Boris Veytsman. This fork is intended to advance BibTeX::Parser to beyond its original scope and become a proper BibTeX library for reading *and* writing of BibTeX files, somewhat like Gergory Ward's `Text::BibTeX` but without its complexity and drawbacks (most notably proper UTF-8 support).

At some point, this fork might need a new name (since it is intended not only as a parser), but for now, it will retain its original name.
